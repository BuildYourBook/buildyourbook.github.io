Most people are looking for pills and potions for their issues.

Let me take a quick diversion to the world of healthcare.

According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published—[the Global Burden of Disease Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23842577/)—the number one cause of death in the United States, and the number one cause of disability, is our diet, which has bumped tobacco smoking to number two.

What we eat is the number one determinant of how long we live. What we eat is what determines most whether we’ll die prematurely. What we eat is what determines most whether we become disabled or not.

Unfortunately, most doctors are just never taught about the impact healthy nutrition can have on the course of illness, and so, they graduate without this powerful tool in their medical toolbox. 

Back in 1980, less than a quarter of medical schools required a single course on nutrition. Today... only a quarter of medical schools require a single course on nutrition. 

Out of this small group, doctors get about 24 hours of nutrition on average, with most getting only 11 to 20On average, out of thousands of hours of preclinical instruction. ([source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736683))

It certainly wasn't in my wife's or my brother-in-law's medical education.

This is mind boggling!

It's no wonder that most people rely on pills and potions. Stand at any check-out counter, and you will see covers that promise you that you can lose 10 lbs in 30 days! Doctors are ill informed (pun fully intended) about this topic themselves and don't really have the time to counsel people about this either.

Back to the practice of law.

Most lawyers (not our loyal readers of course!) will continue seeking the pill. The shortcut. Quick hacks to build your practice perfectly--now!

Much of the content out there--the skinny detox teas of the Biz Dev training world--are also focused on these quick hacks.

Investing in your health takes conscious effort, but the results are far more satisfying and long lasting.

Similarly, investing in building your practice authentically takes conscious intention. But the rewards are far more satisfying. There's a reason why our Authentic Business Builder is 8 weeks long and not focused on "quick hacks" (even though almost everyone recoups the cost of their investment in our course during the course itself).

We're in the business of selling lasting change, positive habits, and a different look at the world. Of course the skills to get included are part of the course as well.

In this new year, choose to invest in making lasting change...both in your diet and your practice.

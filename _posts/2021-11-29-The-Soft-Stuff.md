title: The Soft Stuff
---
Is business development part of the "soft" stuff in the practice of law?

Or is the hard stuff?

Attorneys often come to us asking us for quick tips/tricks/techniques to grow their book of business. 

**7 Ways to Make $7,000 in 7 Days!**

A bit hyperbolic, but you get the point.

We usually stay away from such posts. There are millions of such posts on the Internet. Most of it doesn't work. And it's not the hard stuff.

What's hard is:
- knowing how to sound human to your clients
- showing real interest
- creating trust and respect
- being creative with your strategy
- connecting your "why" to your work
- having the right beliefs to follow-up, experiment, try and try again...
- having conviction in your value to ask for their business

Ironically, these things are considered "soft".

Without them however, the "hard" stuff will give you no results.

Have you spent time on the soft stuff today? What do you struggle with the most?

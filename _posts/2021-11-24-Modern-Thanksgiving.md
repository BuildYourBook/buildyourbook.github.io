Millions of people across America are celebrating Thanksgiving this week. You can too, no matter where are you in the world.

Not so much about celebrating the harvest before winter.

Rather, to celebrate three things:

First, to celebrate the people around us who support us in this hard-to-define work that has its fair share of challenges and complications.

Second, the chance to do something worthwhile with our lives. To solve problems for others, to connect people, ideas, resources, opportunities togethers. That's what the authentic lawyer does everyday. 

Let's never forget that this is our real work and we're making it happen everyday. It's work that matters.

Finally, the commitment to growth. Not everyone wants to grow in this profession and transcend the broken cultural definition of an attorney. You are challenging that, and that makes all the difference.

On behalf of me and Aaron, thank you for doing this everyday.

What are you celebrating?

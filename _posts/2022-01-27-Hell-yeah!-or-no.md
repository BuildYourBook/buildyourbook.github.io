title: Hell yeah! or no

It's not so simple to choose between what's worth including and what isn't in your day.

If it was something truly undesirable (e.g. doing taxes--sorry accountants) and something truly desirable (e.g. date night), it would be easy to fill up our schedules.

But our days are filled with half-hearted 5s, 6s, and 7s in our work and life.

- That committee that you "should" participate in, but has no pay off.
- That event that you "should" go to, even though you've never gotten anything out of them in the past.
- Hosting another panel, to ask the same soft questions and getting non-answers.

5s, 6s, and 7s (at best).

They give off the allure of important and useful, but not really.

Spend enough time in this zone, and our work and our life ends up being in the 5-7 range.

The alternative?

Say yes to just a few things.

The things that excite you, that moves you, that energizes you. That which truly matters.

Say yes to things that make you go "hell yeah!"

Otherwise, say no.

What are you saying "hell yeah!" to?

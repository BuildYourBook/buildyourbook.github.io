Today, we wanted **your** advice.

Our entire purpose with Build Your Book is to share ideas in our podcasts, emails, webinars, courses and more to help professionals like build a solid book of business, build a great practice, and consequently build a great life.

We're working to put together something new, fresh, original, and more helpful.

We wanted to make sure we are covering the topics and issues that are going to be most helpful for YOU...

**So our question to you is this:**

_When it comes to business development and/or building your practice, what's the single biggest challenge you've been struggling with?_

You've undoubtedly heard of the Pareto Principle. The 80/20 rule is all around us.

- 20% of roads are used for 80% of the traffic.
- 20% of the colleges get 80% of student applications.
- 80% of people take vacations at 20% of the calendar year (a bonanza for those who can go off season).

What most people miss is that this applies equally to your life.

This principle tells us that your 20% of your strengths, skills, and relationships account for 80% of the income, satisfaction and opportunities in your life.

The ratios are of course not exactly 80/20. They can be 60:40, 70:30, and increasingly 90:10 and even 99:1.

Most people spend too much time compensating for their weaknesses. Wasting their time on the non-essentials.

You'd be much better off investing in your strengths. The place where you have a disproportionate edge.

If you can build on your strengths and interests, you will get outsized gains.

There's a reason why business development is one of the most sure fire ways to have greater control over your career.

It is the micro skill that disproportionately gives you freedom, control, and mobility in your career.

Everything is not equal.

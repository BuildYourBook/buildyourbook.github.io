title: 4 Mantras that Gave Me Confidence & Focus to Start My Own Law Firm
author: Katie Lipp
---
I created this post-it in 2018 when I was devastated that I didn't win a particular award ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I felt rejected, not good enough, and needed to focus. I was trying to convince myself that I didn't need any external awards to accomplish what I wanted to do (I was right).

I still have this post-it on my nightstand. It keeps me focused on my goals and objectives, + pushes me to keep working hard.

üëë 1Ô∏è‚É£ VALIDATE YOURSELF.
Self-validation is what allows you to accomplish your dreams. You have to believe in yourself and your vision. All that matters is that you are accomplishing the goals and journey you feel called to do - not what others think about them.

üëë 2Ô∏è‚É£ BEGINNER'S MIND
By having a beginner's mind, you are never afraid to try new things + ask difficult questions, which are critical to business growth.

üëë 3Ô∏è‚É£ TAKE THE TICKET.
When you are accomplishing more than you have ever imagined, sometimes you should just "take the ticket" + be willing to receive. We can be our own worst enemies - talking ourselves out of good opportunities, or thinking we aren't deserving of something. If a good opportunity presents itself to you, don't talk yourself out of it - step up to the plate + receive it. You do deserve success + fulfillment. You deserve the best of what the world has to offer.

üëë 4Ô∏è‚É£ PASS THE TEST.
We all want to rise to the next level and achieve success in our lives. But before you can get to the next level, you need to pass the tests right in front of you. You need to master the level you are at to get to the next step.

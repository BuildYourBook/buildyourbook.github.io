title: 'Success Lists, not To-Do Lists'
---
It's time we get past the to-do lists.

Let's face it. Days go by and even when you finish all the tasks on your to-do list, it doesn't feel like you got anything **real** done.

Lean into instead a success list.

The 2-3 things (and no more than that) that you must do everyday. A success list is simple. It's a reminder that if you do just those few things, your day will have mattered.

That you're creating something in the direction of your vision, goals, and dreams.

Otherwise the currents of hollow to-do lists get you stuck in a pit of busyness and not real substantial change that matters.

Doing 5-10 minutes of business development can be one of the most helpful things you can do for your career. 

Easy to do? Yes.

Unless of course you are ruled by to-do lists where you have to put out fires everyday.

What's on your success list?

Which word do you use to describe your dream practice?

Someday is the most vague and ambiguous. It implies no timeline, no plan, and little confidence.

"Someday, I should sit down and figure out how to do this branding thing right."

Someday is something you use for the undefined. It is followed by "should", which implies a rule you're forcing yourself to follow.

Oneday is a bit better.

"One day, I will figure out how to write better."

At least with something like that, you are no longer should-ing on yourself. There is less pressure, and more purpose.

Unfortunately, there is no day called Someday or Oneday in any calendar known to man.

You have today. This month. This year.

Decide to do something today (or a specific day). Don't delegate it to someday or oneday.

Your work is too important to leave to an unknown future.

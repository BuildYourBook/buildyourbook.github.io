Forget the corporate meaning of what a brand is.

It isn't about catchy slogans. It isn't about a tagline.

It's something deeply personal that helps you do everything else.

It helps you stand out from the crowd.
It helps you draw clients (the kind you like working with).
It helps you come up with ideas on what to write on LinkedIn.
It makes you feel good about asking for the business.

I made a ~6 min video all about it.

Watch it and let me know what you think.

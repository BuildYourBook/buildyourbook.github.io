# Our Work is not Copyright

We believe that generosity and abundance are the currency of the 21st century. We believe that authentic lawyers across the world lead with these traits. We've seen in our own life that when we give freely, we get back multi-fold in our contribution, in clients, opportunities, ideas, and happiness.

That's why we are choosing to give away our best ideas to you for free to do as you wish, even commercially. Read the details below about the license we're using.

"No" and "Yes" are not opposites.

They are the two sides of the same coin.

Saying "no" feels restrictive. Rude. Some people say they feel guilty when saying no.

"Yes" feels more freeing. Less disappointing somehow.

This is a false dichotomy.

What matters is what you say "yes" to. Do you know what that is?

- Saying "yes" to dinner time with the family.
- Saying "yes" to your ideal practice.
- Saying "yes" to breaks, meditation, naps, stretching and exercise.

Once you figure out what your "yes" includes, the "no" takes care of itself.

Saying "no" then is not about closing doors. Restriction. Disappointing others. Guilt.

Saying "no" becomes a tool through which you can say yes to the things that really matter.

Today, say yes to what matters, and no to what doesn't. Without guilt, remorse, rudeness, or any form of restriction.

Remember, if it's not a "hell yeah!", it's a "no".

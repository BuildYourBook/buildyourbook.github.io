title: Your Law Practice is a Mirror Reflection of You
---

It's not just about the tools and tactics. It's not (solely) about your knowledge either. Your law practice is determined by your self-image.

Clients often tell us things like: "Everyone says I have to be on LinkedIn, so how do I do that?"

But you don't. You have to think and choose an area where you have an edge--something you do better than anyone else. Ideally, it should be something that only you do. It doesn't even have to be about WHAT you do. After all, many people might be in the same practice area.

Instead, we ask them, "what do **you** enjoy doing? Where do you thrive?"

Your story is an ideal example of this. Your passion, drive, interest, purpose, etc is all part of it.

Based on that, you determine how you want to serve others. That is the only model for sustainably enjoying your career for the rest of your life.

You cannot do effective business development without it. Imagine trying to build your book without knowing what you enjoy the most. Is it speaking? Is it writing? Is it connecting 1-1? 

Without knowing these things, you'd burn out, or you'd stop, or you'd feel stuck and want to give up. Instead, focus on expanding your self-image and the business development part will follow much more easily.

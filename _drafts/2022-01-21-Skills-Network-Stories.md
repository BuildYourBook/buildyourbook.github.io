Your career success depends on all three of these.

Don't make the mistake of focusing on only one or two. Think about ways you can build all three at the same time.

These three will make for a more satisfying career. If you wait until the stars align to do all three, you will never get to do it.

Ironically, the small investments you make in all 3 today will save you a lot more energy, time,  and freedom in the long run.

What have you done today to invest in all three?

title: Waiting for Permission

Have you been waiting for permission?

The permission to send that email to a prospective client. Or host an event. Or claim that your brand is about that new practice area that excites you.

Most people wait forever. They imagine stories in their head.

"What if they think I'm a pest?"

"What if no one shows up when I host this event?"

"What if people find out no one gave me permission?"

"What if no one responds to my post?"

Imagined stories about a nebulous group withdrawing attention/love/business.

Of course those stories are mostly false. 

We keep waiting for someone else to ordain us with the credentials, degrees, awards, the platform for us to put our stake in the ground.

A better approach is to tell yourself a different story. A story that gives you permission now. 

All of these count: Your interest, your value, your passion, your enthusiasm, your curiosity. All these are reason enough to send out that email. To host that event. To make that post. To follow-up.

Will you give yourself permission today?

Would you like to learn 5 quick hacks to increase your book of business in 7 days?

Someone messaged us over the weekend asking us why we don't get into the "hard" stuff. How to setup a CRM, how to write cold emails, etc.

"Show me the tricks!"

Because the "how" part is easy. You can search for it on Google (or DuckDuckGo for the more privacy conscious user), and find thousands of articles.

You will find many "hacks" out there. The equivalent of candy, they won't give you long term consistent results. 

Stick with the principles first.

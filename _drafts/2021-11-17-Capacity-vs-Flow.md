## How do you perceive time?

Of course most of us look at time as a capacity problem. Fill the calendar, build a huge to-do list. Get it all done, tomorrow.

Then the day ends, we're tired and exhausted and wonder what happened. We feel like we're falling behind and wonder why we aren't getting more done.

To make up for it, you decide to skip the morning breakfast or jog. You skip out on sleep.

This leads to burnout. It chronically leaves you dissatisfied with you work.

A better approach would be to look at time as a highway. You fill it with too many cars (tasks) at one time and you get a traffic jam. Pick up the next thing tomorrow, or next week instead of trying to do it simultaneously.

You have just the right amount of cars and you get _flow_ on the roads. Flow is where the magic is. It's when you feel a real sense of **done**. Flow is empowering.
